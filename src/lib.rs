//! Galois Field (2<sup>M</sup>) arithmetic support.
//! 
//! galois_field_2pm provides wrappers for the u8, u16, u32, u64, and u128 types that implement Galois Field arithmetic. There are two implementations:
//! - A look up table based implementation for multiplication and division for Galois Fields defined by a primitive polynomial
//! - A computation based implementation for multiplication and division for Galois Fields defined by an irreducible polynomial
//! 
//! # Getting Started
//! 
//! To start using a Galois Field defined by the irreducible polynomial p(x) âˆˆ GF(2)\[x\] start by representing p(x) as a u128. 
//! An irrecuible polynomial of degree M defines the field GF(2<sup>M</sup>) = GF(2)\[x\] / p(x)
//! Next we need to choose how the field is implemented:
//!     If p(x) is primitive and M <= 16 then the look up table implementation can be used (module gf2_lut)
//!     Else use the computation based implementation (module gf2)
//! Lastly we must use one of the structs to represent the elements in the field. The struct GFuX can be used for M <= X.
//! At this point we can define the GF type and use it.
//! 
//! Consider the example below
//! ```
//! use galois_field_2pm::{GaloisField, gf2_lut};
//! 
//! // First lets define out Galois Field
//! // For irreducible polynomial p(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + x + 1 the u128 representation is given by 0xB.
//! // Note that this p(x) is primitive so we can use either gf2_lut of gf2
//! // Note that GFu8 can represent the field generate by 0xB as the degree of 0xB is 3 and 3 <= 8. For p(x) = 0x211 (degree 9), GFu8 can not be used. GFu16 must be used instead
//! type GF = gf2_lut::GFu8::<0xB>;
//! let a = GF::ONE;
//! let b = GF::new(2);
//! let c = GF {value: 3};
//! 
//! let d = (a + b * c).inverse();
//! ```
//! 
//! For example p(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + x + 1 is represented as 0xB.
